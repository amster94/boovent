            <h3>Refund</h3>
            <p>All the transactions that are going to be held are between organizers and attendees, so in any circumstances of refund, Boovent can only initiate the refund process once Boovent gets the confirmation from the organizer. In case if the event is cancelled, attendees can contact <a href="contact.php">here</a> and ask for a refund. The refund will only be initiated after confirmation from the organizer. Boovent will not be responsible if there is a denial of refund from the organizer.</p>
            <h3>Opt-out/Cancellation Guideline</h3>
            <p>As customer denies or cancel ticket after purchasing then it is solely dependent upon organizer's guideline provided to us during event creation. If still problem persist <a href="contact.php">contact us</a>.</p>
